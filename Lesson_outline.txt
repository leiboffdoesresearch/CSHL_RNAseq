CSHL Cereal Genomics -- Differential Expression by RNAseq

[---Description---]

Hands-on RNAseq: from maize sequence to developmental inference

In this series, we will cover the experimental, technical, and computational considerations of RNAseq analysis.
We will use command-line tools in an unix environment and graphical R interface provided by CyVerse Atmosphere 
to analyze unpublished data from a maize family that is segregating two unlinked mutations. 

Starting with raw sequence data, we will 
1) perform initial quality control, 
2) alignment to a reference genome with a graph-based aligner, 
3) read counting using an union-exon counting method, 
4) read abundance normalization and differential expression analysis,
5) visualize sequencing reads, gene expression, differential gene lists
6) machine learning with inference trees to categorize new data

After this course, students will feel comfortable discussing multiple aspects of RNAseq experimental design and execution.
Using the pipeline and discussion from this course, students will be able to use CyVerse Atmosphere to conduct a variety of analyses as needed for their own research.

[---0. Startup---]

*Night before class
	CyVerse registration
	Register with course: https://user.cyverse.org/workshops/43/overview

*Before Eveland lecture
	Startup instance
	
[---1. Conda and environment management---]

*After Eveland lecture
Welcome to the command line
	Some basic commands
		ls, cd, top, head, less, cat
	Using pipes and capturing output streams
		Example: cat * | wc -l #counts the number of lines in * files
	Manual pages
		or Google is your BFF
	Project directory management
	sudo chown $(whoami) /scratch
Installing conda and environment management
	Command line tools have lots of dependancies; environment managers can keep them sorted
	Install conda, say yes a bunch, and 'source ~/.bashrc'
		# conda this step is interactive-- use a terminal
		wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
		bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
		# scroll down and say 'yes'
		
		conda config --add channels defaults
		conda config --add channels bioconda
		conda config --add channels conda-forge
		
	Create new conda environment for RNAseq alignment and counting
		conda config --set changeps1 false
		conda install -y --name alignment python=3.6 fastp samtools hisat2 subread
*Move on to RNAseq lesson while env solves
		conda activate alignment
		
[---2. RNAseq Alignment and Counting---]

What is RNAseq?
	What can you do with RNAseq?
	Outline of steps for differential expression analysis
		Experiment design -- replicates vs depth
		Sequencing -- full length transcript vs 3'UTR
		Quality control
		Alignment
		Read counting
		Differential expression
		Analysis

Setting up an RNAseq experiment
	Our example -- Lgn;nod, Lgn, nod, Wild-Type
		What questions can we ask with RNAseq?
	Experiment design -- Genomics: Garbage in, garbage out
		Minimize confounding factors
		Number of replicates vs sequencing depth
	Library preparation and sequencing chemistry
		Full length transcript vs 3'UTR enrichment
		Illumina sequence length -- longer is not always better
	
*activate conda env
		conda activate alignment

Short read data structures
	What is FASTQ format?
	Exercise: head, less, tail, wc to browse data
	
Illumina short read quality control
	Quality statistics
	Adapter contamination + trimming
	Exercise: Run fastp, transfer to personal computer to view
	
Before you align
	Reference genomes and where to find them
		.fa files
		.gtf and .gff files
	Exercise: find the most recent maize reference genome
	
Basics of alignment
	What is an alignment?
		BLAST as an example
		Quick explanation of graph-based aligners
	What aligners are out there? What are they good at?
		Genomic -- Bowtie2
		Long genomic -- minimap2
		Rapid pseudoalign -- Kallisto + Salmon
		Transcriptomic -- HiSAT2 (tophat2)
	How do you run an alignment command?
		Normally, we would create a genome index, but we will skip to save time...
	Exercise: Browse HiSAT2 manual, discuss general command, which options and determining values
	Exercise: Run alignment for 1 file as .sam
	
Browsing aligned-read pileup
	Exercise: Use head to look at .sam format
	Visualize an alignment with IGV
	Discuss EPIC CoGe, JBrowse
	
	Run: Alignment of all files
	
Read counting
	Discuss read counting methods: Union-exon models, expectation maximization (EM)
	Example read counters
		Flexible reference-based: featureCounts
		Reference, with option of novel splice forms: stringtie2 
	
[---3. DEG and analysis---]

Switch conda environments (or start install.packages on personal machines)
		conda install -y --name DEG python=3.6 r_env r-essentials r-base r-ggplot2 r-deseq2 r-pheatmap
		
*Move on to DEG discussion while env solves or folks run packages.install
* and download from datastore/github
		conda activate DEG

What is differential expression (DE) analysis?
	Read abundance estimation -- why do it?
		Examples of data bias

Common read abundance methods
	Brief overview: Negative binomial, Poisson distributions, expectation maximization (EM)	
	Examples
		Isoform from alignments -- cufflinks, stringtie2/ballgown
		Isoforms from pseudoalignments -- sleuth
		General DE tools -- DEseq2 (conservative), edgeR (promiscuous)
